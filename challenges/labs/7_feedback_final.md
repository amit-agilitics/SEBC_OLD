SEBC session at singapore was great. 
I struggled mostly in parts of MySQL where versions conflict caused me to be behind of the class but later point of time I did
catch up. Lots of learning and lots of hands on. Good thing about this session is...this session is about doing not hearing. 
As we are professional and not a novice in this arena...definitely we look forward to real stuff of doers that was present in 
this course as advance topic.

I have worked quite extensively on the topic mentioned after our session and did deploy a production cluster by myself for a Insurance client.The only major thing I think I need to work on is on TLS security. 

Thank you michael and team for making it happen.
